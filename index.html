      <h2>A lil note for You! ðŸ’Œ</h2>
      <p>Happy Birthday, my LOVE aka Mr. Pratham Gaikwad aka Pooku ðŸŽ€! I hope today surrounds you with all the love, light, and warmth youâ€™ve brought into
         my life since the very first day we met. Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot back to the day our paths crossed 
         for the very first time (or maybe just Dal khichdi crossed paths with Pav Bhaji iykyk hehehe ðŸ˜œ). I had no idea then that 
         youâ€™d become my person! The one I would trust with my heart, my laughter, and my quietest thoughts ðŸŒŸ.</p>

      <p>From the start, we just clicked, didnâ€™t we? ðŸ‘» (or maybe it was what we clicked (ðŸ“¸ the literal love for photography ) that brought us together and even closer)
         As if we had been synced in some parallel universe even before this one ðŸŒŒ. 
          Our conversations flowed like weâ€™d known each other forever, and somehow, you already understood parts of me no one else 
          had even noticed. We bonded over the tiniest, most random things... song(Iktara), movie(Life of PI...iykyk ðŸ‘»), food (Dal Khichdi & Pav Bhaji), place(Marine Drive),
          hobbies(travel, photography, cricket, food (Yes our love for art!)) and suddenly, everything just felt fucking right!! ðŸ’«.</p>
        
        <p>Every moment weâ€™ve shared since then has only made me love my Pooku more! The way you smile at me when Iâ€™m being silly, the 
        way you hold me when Iâ€™m feeling low, the way you just get me even when I donâ€™t say a word. Itâ€™s magic. And even you guessing 
        what your this special gift is also a Magic! (yes this lil effor of mine) You are My magic lil Star âœ¨.
      You literally listen to every word that comes out from my mouth, never let it fall down, I said you look cute in a wide smile and 
    since then everytime you click a picture, you make sure to show your teeth! How cute is that!!! You trying to do every lil improvement i ask you to.
  I literally feel so blessed to have someone who puts in sooo much efforts juss to see me happyðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹</p>
        
        <p>But I want you to know something important today:
        Iâ€™m not just here for the good days, Iâ€™m here especially for the tough ones ðŸ¥¹. When life feels heavy, when things donâ€™t go as planned, 
        when you feel tired, when you feel lost, when you need a shoulder to lean on... Iâ€™ll be right there, loving you just the same ðŸ’—.
        I wonâ€™t just cheer you on when youâ€™re at your bestâ€¦ Iâ€™ll hold you tight in my arms when youâ€™re at your lowest. Because thatâ€™s 
        what love is, and thatâ€™s what WE are ðŸ’ž.</p>
        
        <p>You don't know but Youâ€™ve become so much more than my boyfriend.
        You are my peace.
        You are my warmth.
        You are my safe place.
        You are the love I always dreamed of, even when I didnâ€™t know it was you I was dreaming of ðŸ¥ºðŸ¦‹.</p>
        
        <p>So today, on your birthday, I want to thank you-
        For existing.
        For being you.
        For being mine.
        For choosing me too.
        And for letting me love you, completely.May this year bring you closer to your dreams, and may we make a thousand more memories together... laughing, growing, 
        supporting, and loving each other through every season.</p>
        
        <p>I love you. Not just in the romantic fairytale kind of way... but in every lil way i can and I always will. Probably until you read this
          I'd have wished you a thousand times but once again...Happy Birthday!! ðŸŽ‚ My Pooku BabyðŸŽ€, My SunshineðŸŽ€, My P for RasmalaiðŸŽ€, My Cutu PutuðŸŽ€, My Kuchu PuchuðŸŽ€, My SweetuðŸŽ€!!</p>
